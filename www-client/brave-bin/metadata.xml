		Brave is a free and open-source web browser developed by Brave Software, Inc.
		based on the Chromium web browser. It blocks ads and website trackers, and
		provides a way for users to send cryptocurrency contributions in the form of
		Basic Attention Tokens (BAT) to websites and content creators.

		Brave distinguishes itself from other Chromium-based browsers through features
		focused on privacy:
		- Built-in ad blocker and tracker blocker
		- HTTPS Everywhere integration
		- Script blocking
		- Third-party cookie blocking
		- Brave Shields for per-site privacy settings
		- Brave Rewards (optional BAT rewards system)
		- Brave Wallet for cryptocurrency
		- Tor integration in private windows
		- Built-in IPFS support

		This is the binary package that downloads pre-compiled releases from Brave's
		official GitHub repository, providing faster installation and updates compared
		to building from source.

		NOTE: This binary package includes ALL optional components (Brave Rewards,
		Brave Wallet, Tor, VPN support, etc.) pre-compiled. These features can be
		enabled or disabled through Brave's settings interface at runtime. For
		build-time control of optional components, use www-client/brave-browser instead.
